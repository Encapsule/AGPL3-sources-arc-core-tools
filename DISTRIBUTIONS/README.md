# ARCmaster/DISTRIBUTIONS

This directory is owned by the private ARCmaster repository but its contents is not.

Rather, the subdirectories of this DISTRIBUTIONS are stand-alone public repositories that are populated with build output generated by the ARCmaster project.

The Node.js tool ecosystem is simply too fragile to support really agile development of large multi-package projects: there are just too many things that can (and do frequently) go wrong.

So I'm going back to a big master repository strategy that I can more easily manage working by myself. This also provides me with really excellent control over the public repositories (far better I think than if I tried to keep them all up-to-date manually like I've tried to do for the past month or two).
